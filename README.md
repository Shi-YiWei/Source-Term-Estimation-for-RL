# Source-Term-Estimation-for-RL
The Environment of Source Term Estimation (STE) for RL

The STE environments for the discrete and continuous action spaces are implemented in folder STE_Env_continuous discrete and folder STE_Env_continuous, respectively.

The action in the discrete action space is [front, back, left, right].  

The action in continuous action space is $` r sin\theta `$
